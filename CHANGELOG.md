# 3.0.0-beta.4
- reverted meta to 1.3 as flutter_test isn't compatible with meta 1.7 Fixes: #47

# 3.0.0-beta.3
- upgraded to latest meta.
- moved to lints package.
- added [] and []= operators to access Currencies.
- cleaned up package imports.

# 3.0.0-beta.2
Revised the Money constructors to take a currency 'code' rather than a currency.

```
Money.from(100, CommonCurrency.usd);

becomes

Money.from(100, 'USD');

Old methods are still available as:

Money.fromWithCurrency(100, CommonCurrency.usd);

```

To support this CommonCurrencies are now automatically registered.

# 3.0.0-beta.1
Breaking changes
- re-implemented each of the == operator to use 'covariant' rather than taking a dynamic as this moves the type check to a compile time error rather than a runtime error. You can nolonger pass a dynamic to the == operator.
- Changed the Currencies class to a singleton as per #38. You will need to change calls such as:
```
Currencies.register() -> Currences().register();
Currencies.registerAll() -> Currences().registerAll();
Currencies.parse() -> Currences().parse();
```
- restructured the unit test directory so it confirms to the recommended structure.
